(rephrased for clarity)

The following two premises are true:

1. One of the following statements is true, but not both:
  a. If there is a king in the hand then there is an ace.
  b. If there isnâ€™t a king in the hand then there is an ace.

2. There is a king in the hand.

What can you infer from these premises?
